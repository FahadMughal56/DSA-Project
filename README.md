DSA Project: Student Management System
Overview
This project implements a Student Management System using three different data structures: Linked List, Queue, and Stack. Each data structure serves a specific purpose in managing student records.

Features
Linked List
Insert Record: Adds a new student record to the linked list and stores the data in a file.
Search Record: Finds and displays a specific student record based on the student ID.
Edit Record: Modifies the information of a student record using the student ID.
Delete Record: Removes a student record from the linked list and updates the file.
Show All Records: Displays all student records stored in the linked list.
Queue
Push Record: Adds a new student record to the queue.
Display Records: Shows all the student records currently in the queue.
Pop Record: Removes the front record from the queue.
Stack
Push Record: Adds a new student record to the stack.
Display Records: Shows all the student records currently in the stack.
Pop Record: Removes the top record from the stack.
Top/Peek Value: Displays the top record without removing it.
Size: Shows the number of elements in the stack.
Clear: Removes all records from the stack.
Usage
Linked List:

Choose option 1 in the main menu.
Follow the prompts to insert, search, edit, delete, or display student records.
Queue:

Choose option 2 in the main menu.
Follow the prompts to push, display, or pop student records from the queue.
Stack:

Choose option 3 in the main menu.
Follow the prompts to push, display, pop, check the top value, get the size, or clear the stack.
Exit Program:

Choose option 0 in the main menu to exit the program.
File Handling
Student records in the linked list are stored in a file named "list.txt".
The file is updated whenever a new record is inserted, edited, or deleted.
Note
The program uses a menu-driven approach for easy navigation.
Each data structure operates independently, and data is not shared between them.
